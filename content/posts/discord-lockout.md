I got back in. Thanks dad!

So Discord locked me out.

I was just going about my business, then I'm hit with a page that just says "something is going on here". It forces me to verify a phone number.

The only phone numbers I have are landline or VOIP. Which conveniently, Discord doesn't allow for phone numbers.

I'll be off Discord until I can sort this out. The support team is garbage - stop taking away a large chunk of people's lives, Discord!

The accounts user.exe's messenger#4960 (ID 956288051678707782) and user.exe's second messenger#0571 (956297946868092978) is mine.
