So for school we have to learn *sign language*, and it's quite difficult. Like very. I think.

We're using this site called [sign school](https://signschool.com), which tries to make it "fun" but it's kinda disturbing. Here's an example: [click click click me](https://og.blurple.rip/SignSchool_Joe_and_Ann_Scene_1_(Voice)-txQbuSJ5V4M.mp4)

I'm not sure what it is I just want to see if my rss feed works lol
