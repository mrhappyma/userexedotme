      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do this post for a while, so here it is.
The base site The site itself is made with hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s a really cool static site generator that lets me write posts in markdown. I write my post, plop it in /content/posts/whatever.md, run hugo, and the site gets built into /public in less than a second.
I can even run hugo serve --navigateToChanged and it will host my site on localhost port 1313, rebuilding every time I save a file, and redirect my already open window to whatever page was saved last.</description>
