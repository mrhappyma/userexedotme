      <title>How my website works</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do this post for a while, so here it is.
The base site The site itself is made with hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s a really cool static site generator that lets me write posts in markdown. I write my post, plop it in /content/posts/whatever.md, run hugo, and the site gets built into /public in less than a second.
I can even run hugo serve --navigateToChanged and it will host my site on localhost port 1313, rebuilding every time I save a file, and redirect my already open window to whatever page was saved last.</description>

      <title>My Problem with Apple</title>

      <description>Note This post is not ment as &amp;ldquo;Apple should go to hell&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s an explination for &amp;ldquo;why don&amp;rsquo;t you like Apple&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stuff that Apple does do a good job on - have you seen the M1 Ultra? - but that is not this post. There&amp;rsquo;s also other stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t like but this is the big ones. Apple stuff only works with other Apple stuff Apple has made itself the Apple ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Locked out of my Discord</title>
      <link>https://www.userexe.me/posts/discord-lockout/</link>

      <description>Info I got back in. Thanks dad! So Discord locked me out.
I was just going about my buisness, then I&amp;rsquo;m hit with a page that just says &amp;ldquo;something is going on here&amp;rdquo;. It forces me to verify a phone number.
The only phone numbers I have are landline or VOIP. Which conveniently, Discord doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for phone numbers.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be off Discord until I can sort this out. The support team is garbage - stop taking away a large chunk of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, Discord!</description>

      <description>So for school we have to learn sign language, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult. Like very. I think.
We&amp;rsquo;re using this site called sign school, which tries to make it &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s kinda disturbing. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: click click click me
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what it is I just want to see if my rss feed works lol</description>

      <description>My Projects Duckers Duckers is a simple Discord bot that does pretty simple things: type /quack and get a duck!
Duckers was made to modal my random-d.uk Autocode intigration (still WiP).

Duckers (outdated) website Duckers Autocode intigration Duckers on top.gg Duckers on bot.gg Suggestionator Suggestionator is my WiP Discord bot with the goal of being the most uber-customizable suggestions bot. With everything from custom outputs and forms and whanot planned, it&amp;rsquo;s currently a peice of crap since I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to work on it in a while.</description>
