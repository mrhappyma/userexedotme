      <title>Locked out of my Discord</title>

      <description>So Discord locked me out.
I was just going about my buisness, then I&amp;rsquo;m hit with a page that just says &amp;ldquo;something is going on here&amp;rdquo;. It forces me to verify a phone number.
The only phone numbers I have are landline or VOIP. Which conveniently, Discord doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for phone numbers.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be off Discord until I can sort this out. The support team is garbage - stop taking away a large chunk of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, Discord!</description>

      <description>So for school we have to learn sign language, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult. Like very. I think.
We&amp;rsquo;re using this site called sign school, which tries to make it &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s kinda disturbing. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: click click click me
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what it is I just want to see if my rss feed works lol</description>
