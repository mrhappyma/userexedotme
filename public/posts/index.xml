      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do this post for a while, so here it is.
The base site The site itself is made with hugo. It&amp;rsquo;s a really cool static site generator that lets me write posts in markdown. I write my post, plop it in /content/posts/whatever.md, run hugo, and the site gets built into /public in less than a second.
I can even run hugo serve --navigateToChanged and it will host my site on localhost port 1313, rebuilding every time I save a file, and redirect my already open window to whatever page was saved last.</description>

      <description>Note This post is not ment as &amp;ldquo;Apple should go to hell&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s an explination for &amp;ldquo;why don&amp;rsquo;t you like Apple&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of stuff that Apple does do a good job on - have you seen the M1 Ultra? - but that is not this post. There&amp;rsquo;s also other stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t like but this is the big ones. Apple stuff only works with other Apple stuff Apple has made itself the Apple ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Locked out of my Discord</title>

      <description>Info I got back in. Thanks dad! So Discord locked me out.
I was just going about my buisness, then I&amp;rsquo;m hit with a page that just says &amp;ldquo;something is going on here&amp;rdquo;. It forces me to verify a phone number.
The only phone numbers I have are landline or VOIP. Which conveniently, Discord doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for phone numbers.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be off Discord until I can sort this out. The support team is garbage - stop taking away a large chunk of people&amp;rsquo;s lives, Discord!</description>

      <description>So for school we have to learn sign language, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult. Like very. I think.
We&amp;rsquo;re using this site called sign school, which tries to make it &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s kinda disturbing. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: click click click me
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what it is I just want to see if my rss feed works lol</description>
